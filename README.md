## About this Project
This is the starter project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## How to Run

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
